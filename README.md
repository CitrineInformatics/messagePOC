Chat module for Node
________________________

Chatroom module developed using sockets.io and node.js

There are two branches one using JQuery and one using Vue.js
The Vue.js branch will eventually be merged into master branch and the JQuery branch will not be maintained.

This will be implemented into larger communication application

To run, make sure you have installed Node.js I used the Current but I'm sure LTS works fine

from the project root directory:

npm install // This might actually happen by default.
node server.js

Have fun :)
